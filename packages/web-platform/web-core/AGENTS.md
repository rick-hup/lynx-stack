# Web Core WASM

This package (`packages/web-platform/web-core`) is the high-performance core of the Lynx Web Platform, implemented primarily in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). It handles computation-intensive tasks and facilitates the interaction between the Lynx runtime and the browser DOM.

## Overview

The `web-core` package bridges the gap between Lynx's native-like architecture and the web platform. Its primary responsibilities include:

1. **CSS Processing**: High-performance tokenization and transformation of Lynx-specific CSS (e.g., `rpx` units, `linear` layout) into standard Web CSS.
2. **Template Management**: efficient binary serialization (`encode`) and deserialization (`decode`) of style templates using `rkyv`.
3. **Main Thread Runtime**: Managing the state of Lynx elements, DOM manipulation, and event handling on the main thread.
4. **Background Thread Service (BTS)**: Hosting the Lynx logic (React/JavaScript) in a Web Worker to ensure UI responsiveness.

## Architecture & Modules

The codebase is structured into three main layers: the **Rust Core** (`src`), the **Client Runtime** (`ts/client`), and the **Encoder** (`ts/encode`).

### 1. Rust Core (`src`)

The Rust code forms the logic backbone, compiled into WASM.

- **`main_thread`**: The core runtime logic.
  - **`MainThreadWasmContext`**: The central state holder. It manages the DOM tree, element metadata, template instances, and event configuration.
  - **`element_apis`**: Implements the logic for manipulating elements.
    - **`element_data.rs`**: Stores per-element metadata (`LynxElementData`), including CSS IDs, component IDs, and datasets.
    - **`event_apis.rs`**: Handles event registration and dispatching (both standard events and "worklet" events).
    - **`style_apis.rs`**: Provides style manipulation APIs, utilizing `CSSProperty::from_id`.
  - **`js_binding`**: Defines the `RustMainthreadContextBinding` to expose these Rust methods to JavaScript.

- **`css_tokenizer`**: A CSS tokenizer ported from `css-tree`, fully compliant with CSS Syntax Level 3.
- **`style_transformer`**: Transforms Lynx CSS into Web CSS using the strongly-typed `CSSProperty` enum for efficiency. Handles `rpx` unit resolution (via `token_transformer`) and complex property rules.
- **`template`**: Defines the schema for binary templates (`RawStyleInfo`) and handles their `rkyv` serialization.
  - **`css_property.rs`**: Defines the `CSSProperty` enum (u16 IDs) and shared `ParsedDeclaration` struct. Uses `rkyv` instead of `serde`. Unknown properties are treated homogeneously.
- **`leo_asm`**: Defines "Leo Assembly" opcodes (e.g., `CreateElement`, `SetAttribute`) used to efficiently reconstruct DOM trees from templates.
- **`utils`**: General purpose utilities.
  - **`hyphenate_style_name.rs`**: Converts camelCase style names to kebab-case (e.g., `backgroundColor` -> `background-color`). **Note**: Assumes no `ms` vendor prefix.

### 2. Client Runtime (`ts/client`)

TypeScript bindings that load the WASM module and build the browser environment.

#### Main Thread (`ts/client/mainthread`)

Handles DOM rendering and user interaction.

- **`LynxView.ts`**: The `<lynx-view>` custom element. It initializes the `LynxViewInstance` and acts as the entry point.
- `ts/client/mainthread/TemplateManager.ts`: Manages template loading and processing. a dedicated `decode.worker.js` to parse binary templates off-main-thread.
- `src/template/template_sections/style_info`: Contains style information modules (`raw_style_info.rs`, `css_property.rs`, `style_info_decoder.rs`) which define the schema and decoding logic for styles.
- `src/main_thread/style_manager.rs`: Manages styles, handles CSS selector logic and CSS OG style updates.
- **`elementAPIs/createElementAPI.ts`**: A JavaScript facade over the Wasm `MainThreadWasmContext`. It provides methods like `__CreateElement` and `__SetAttribute` that bridge JS calls to the underlying Rust logic.
- **`elementAPIs/WASMJSBinding.ts`**: Mocks or proxies the Wasm binding for testing or non-Wasm environments.

#### Background Thread (`ts/client/background`)

Runs the application logic (BTS).

- **`startBackgroundThread.ts`**: Bootstraps the background worker, establishing RPC with the main thread.
- **`createNativeApp.ts`**: Creates the `NativeApp` interface, which mimics the native Lynx environment for the application code. It proxies commands (like `createElement`) to the main thread via RPC.
- **`createBackgroundLynx.ts`**: Sets up the global `lynx` object in the worker.

### 3. Server Runtime (`ts/server`)

TypeScript bindings for Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

- **`wasm.ts`**: Loads the server-specific Wasm binary.
- **`elementAPIs/createElementAPI.ts`**: Implements `ElementPAPIs` and returns the `wasmContext` for the server, using `MainThreadServerContext` to generate HTML strings instead of manipulating DOM.

### 4. Encoder (`ts/encode`)

Build-time utilities.

- **`encodeCSS.ts`**: Uses the `encode` feature of the Wasm module to serialize CSS ASTs into binary format during the build process.

## Data Flow

### 1. Template Loading & Rendering

1. **Fetch**: `TemplateManager` fetches the binary template bundle.
2. **Decode**: The bundle is sent to `decode.worker.js`, where it is parsed into `ElementTemplateSection`s.
3. **Render**: `LynxViewInstance` receives the decoded data.
4. **Assembly**: The Wasm core executes `leo_asm` opcodes to construct the actual DOM nodes via `createElementAPI`.

### 2. Event Handling

1. **User Action**: User interacts with a DOM element (e.g., click).
2. **Dispatch**: The event is captured by the main thread listener.
3. **Routing**:
   - If it's a **Worklet** event, it's processed on the Main Thread.
   - If it's a **BTS** (standard) event, it's sent via RPC to the Background Thread to trigger the React/JS handler.
4. **Coordinate normalization**: For events with positional payloads (`layoutchange`, `touch*`, `mouse*`, `click`/`tap`) and for the `boundingClientRect` UI method, the host `<lynx-view>`'s viewport top-left is subtracted from the emitted coordinate fields so consumers receive lynx-view-relative values, matching native Lynx semantics. The lynx-view's rect is cached by `BoundingClientRectService` (one per `LynxViewInstance`); the cache is invalidated at most once per `requestAnimationFrame`, so CSS `transform`s on the lynx-view (which `ResizeObserver` would miss) are eventually picked up without a per-event measurement and without amplifying event-modification feedback loops.

## Development & Build

This package uses a hybrid build system involving `pnpm`, `rsbuild`, and `cargo`.

### Scripts

- **`pnpm build`**: Runs `scripts/build.js`.
  1. Compiles Rust to Wasm (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`) using `cargo`.
  2. Generates high-performance JS bindings with `wasm-bindgen`.
  3. Optimizes the binary size with `wasm-opt`.
  4. Builds three variants: `client` (browser runtime), `server` (SSR), and `encode` (build tool).
- **`pnpm test`**: Runs `rstest`. Note: If you modify Rust code, you must run `pnpm build:wasm` first for the changes to take effect in the tests.

### Configuration

- **`rsbuild.config.ts`**: Configures the bundling of the client-side JavaScript, ensuring correct entry points (`ts/client/index.ts`) and output paths.
- **`rstest.config.ts`**: Configures the test runner, including mappings to load the Wasm binary during tests.

### Testing Strategy

- **`tests/element-apis.spec.ts`**: A key test file. It validates the `MainThreadWasmContext` logic by mocking the Wasm binding entirely in JavaScript (`WASMJSBinding.ts`). This allows testing DOM manipulation logic without loading the actual Wasm binary in every test.
- **`tests/encode.spec.ts`**: Verifies that the CSS encoder correctly serializes various CSS rules.
- **`tests/lazy-load.spec.ts`**: Ensures that custom elements are loaded dynamically only when needed.
- **Rust Tests**: run `cargo test --all-features` and `cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --all-features` separately.
- **Server E2E Tests (`packages/web-platform/web-core-e2e`)**:
  - Located in `packages/web-platform/web-core-e2e`.
  - Uses `rstest` to run server tests against the **built artifacts** (e.g., `dist/api-globalThis.web.bundle`).
  - Verifies server-side execution of templates using `executeTemplate` and isolated VM contexts.
  - Run with `pnpm test:server` inside the `web-core-e2e` directory. `pnpm test` is reserved for Playwright e2e tests.

## Guidelines for LLMs

1. **Context Matters**: Determine if you are working on **Core Logic** (Rust), **Binding Logic** (TypeScript), or **Application Logic** (BTS).
2. **Performance is Key**: This package is the engine. Avoid main-thread blocking concepts. Prefer Wasm for heavy compute.
3. **Testing**: When modifying `src/main_thread`, ALWAYS add corresponding tests in `tests/element-apis.spec.ts` to verify the JS-side behavior.
4. **Documentation**: Keep this file updated if you add new modules or change the architecture.

## Technical Learnings

### WASM <-> JS Interop

- **Recursive Borrowing**: Avoid patterns where Rust calls JS, and JS immediately calls back into Rust to retrieve data that Rust already possesses. This will cause `RefCell` borrowing panics ("recursive use of an object").
- **`MainThreadWasmContext` exports take `&self`, never `&mut self`**: `wasm-bindgen` wraps an exported struct in a `WasmRefCell` and holds a borrow for the whole exported call — shared for `&self`, exclusive for `&mut self`. Event dispatch re-enters JS while such a call is on the stack (`common_event_handler` → `runWorklet` / `runElementClosure`), and the main-thread handler on the other side may call any Element PAPI. A single `&mut self` export therefore makes the documented mutate-then-flush pattern throw "recursive use of an object" once per event, and the throw unwinds through the dispatcher, skipping every handler ordered after it. Mutable state lives behind `RefCell`/`Cell` fields instead.
- **Never hold a `RefCell` borrow across a call into JS**: the same rule one level down, and it applies to `LynxElementData` too. `dispatch_event_by_path` reads an element's handlers, dataset and parent component id out of the cell and drops the borrow before running any of them, because a handler is free to write to the element it is dispatching on. Take what is needed, drop the borrow, then call out.
- **Object Passing**: Instead of passing IDs (like `uniqueId`) from Rust to JS and having JS callback to retrieve the object, pass the object reference (e.g., `&web_sys::HtmlElement`) directly from Rust to JS. `wasm-bindgen` handles this seamlessly and key for avoiding re-entrant calls.

### External Bundles (`lynx.fetchBundle` / `lynx.loadScript`)

External bundles let a card load extra `.web.bundle`s at runtime (used by `@lynx-js/externals-loading-webpack-plugin`). Web supports the **async** path only (there is no `promise.wait()`).

**Key idea: mts and bts chunks have different formats, so don't lump them into one custom/external section — route each to the bundle slot whose format it matches, exactly like the card does.** An external bundle's mts chunk rides `LepusCode`, its bts chunk rides `Manifest`, its CSS rides `StyleInfo`. The decode worker + runtime then reuse the card's own lepus/manifest paths.

- `lynx.fetchBundle(url)` → `Promise<{ url, code, errorMsg }>` (`code` `0` = ok, `-1` = fail, `-2` = timeout-not-supported). `LynxViewInstance.loadExternalBundle` decodes it through the same `TemplateManager` + decode worker as a lazy component (`queryComponent`), with override config `{ isLazy: 'false', isExternalBundle: 'true' }`. Its section handlers do the registration automatically: `Manifest` → `onBTSScriptsLoaded` → `updateBTSChunk(url, backgroundCode)` (bts worker `templateCache`); `LepusCode` → `onMTSScriptsLoaded` → `lepusCodeUrls.set(url, …)` (mts). The `urlMap['root']` guard skips the page render (an external bundle has no `root` chunk), and `startBTS()` is idempotent.
- `lynx.loadScript(sectionPath, { bundleName })` returns a section's exports:
  - **bts**: `nativeApp.loadScript(sectionPath, bundleName)` → `readScript` from `templateCache` (`/<sectionPath>`) → the bts chunk wrapper. **The plugin consumes the return value as the module's exports**, and lynx-core (>= 0.1.4) runs the `init`.
  - **mts**: `lepusCodeUrls.get(bundleName)[sectionPath]` → the decode-worker-built blob url → `mtsRealm.loadScriptSync` returns its `module.exports`.

**The two realms wire `lynx` differently — check both when touching either API:**

- **bts** (`createBackgroundLynx`): the worker's `lynx` is built by `@lynx-js/lynx-core` (web-core requires **>= 0.1.4**). lynx-core calls `getNativeLynx().loadScript` / `getNativeLynx().fetchBundle` — forwarded from `createBackgroundLynx`, so those methods **must** be defined there (removing `loadScript` makes `lynx.loadScript` `undefined` and the externals call throws — verified by the `external-bundle` e2e). In **>= 0.1.4** lynx-core's own `loadScript` wrapper runs `_$executeInit` (and caches) on the returned `{ init }` object, so `createBackgroundLynx.loadScript` returns `nativeApp.loadScript(...)` **without** calling `.init`. (Historical: 0.1.3 forwarded `lynx.loadScript = getNativeLynx().loadScript` verbatim with no init handling, so there the method had to call `.init` itself.)
- **mts** (`createMainThreadGlobalAPIs` / `createMainThreadLynx`): injected into the iframe realm; `loadScript` resolves the section's blob url from `lepusCodeUrls` and evals it via `mtsRealm.loadScriptSync`.

### Web binary external bundle build

Built with `defineExternalBundleRslibConfig(userLibConfig, { target: 'web' })` from `@lynx-js/lynx-bundle-rslib-config` (default `target: 'tasm'` = native bundle via `@lynx-js/tasm`). For the **web** target, `webEncode.ts` routes each section by the `encoding` tag `ExternalBundleWebpackPlugin` sets from the chunk's layer — not by name, since a user-declared `layer: 'main-thread'` entry has no `__main-thread` suffix:

- `JsBytecode` (main-thread chunk) → `lepusCode` (the mts chunk).
- other JS → `manifest` (the bts chunk), keyed `/<sectionPath>` to match the card's `/app-service.js` convention.
- `CSS` → `StyleInfo` (the web style engine pre-processes it; never rebuild stylesheets in the browser).
- JS is kept as **raw source** (the `JsBytecode` tag only selects the slot) — do **not** add the lynx_core AMD wrapper at build time; the runtime wraps each chunk at load. Encoded via `@lynx-js/web-core/encode` (`SDRA`/`WROF` magic header).

### Decode worker chunk wrappers (mts format mismatch)

The external mts chunk is a webpack/rspack **library** that writes to bare `exports`. The bts chunk wrapper (`createBundleInitReturnObj`) passes `exports` as a parameter, so the bts chunk fits `Manifest` directly. But the `LepusCode` decode wrapper is `(function(){ const navigator=…; [module.exports=]CODE })()` — it provides the iframe `module` but **not** `exports`, and its lazy variant expects CODE to be an _expression_ (the shape lazy-component roots use). So the decode worker's `LepusCode` case has an **external variant** (gated on `config.isExternalBundle`) that prepends `var exports=(module.exports={});` to give the library chunk a CommonJS env. Don't try to make one wrapper serve both shapes — the lazy _expression_ form and the library _exports_ form are incompatible.

### Style-engine test gotcha

When testing external/lazy stylesheets, assert **`background-color`**, not `color`: the web style transformer makes `color` cascade/inherit, so a `color` assertion can pass even when the stylesheet was never applied (false positive). `decode_style_info`'s `entryName` (set when `isLazy`) scopes selectors with `[l-e-name="<url>"]`; pass `isLazy: 'false'` to load an external bundle's CSS globally.

## Benchmarking

### Rust (wasm32)

- Run: cargo bench --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --all-features
- Bench entry: packages/web-platform/web-core/benches/wasm_bench.rs
- Bench helper module: packages/web-platform/web-core/benches/support/bench_support.rs

Notes:

- Keep helper modules under benches/support/ so Cargo does not treat them as standalone benchmark targets.
- The helper is included into the crate via a #[path = "../benches/support/bench_support.rs"] module in src/lib.rs, gated behind cfg(all(feature = "client", feature = "encode", target_arch = "wasm32")).
